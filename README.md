# 📊 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## ✅ Project Overview
This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques. The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters based on their demographic and spending behavior. This helps businesses develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Perform customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Visualize customer groups using **PCA**.
- Identify high-value customers and provide actionable business insights.
- Recommend marketing strategies for each customer group.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details
**File**: `Customer_data.csv`

| Column Name                | Description                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CustomerID                | Unique identifier for each customer |
| Gender                    | Male/Female                        |
| Age                       | Age of the customer                |
| Annual Income (k$)        | Annual income in thousands         |
| Spending Score (1-100)    | Spending behavior score            |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
3. **Optimal Cluster Selection**
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to find the ideal number of clusters.
4. **Clustering**
   - Applied **K-Means Clustering** with the optimal cluster count.
5. **Visualization**
   - Reduced dimensions using **PCA** for 2D cluster visualization.
   - Plotted customer clusters and their centroids.
6. **Recommendations**
   - Delivered insights for targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and marketing strategies.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

| Cluster | Age Group | Income Level | Spending Behavior | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| 0       | Older (55+) | Medium     | Moderate         | Senior benefits, practical product bundles |
| 1       | Young Adults (30s) | High | High           | Premium products, VIP services, loyalty programs |
| 2       | Young (20s) | Lower-Middle | Moderate       | Seasonal discounts, trendy products |
| 3       | Older (45+) | Low        | Low              | Budget-friendly offers |
| 4       | Middle-Aged (40s) | High | Low            | Re-engagement strategies, personalized offers |

## 📊 Results
- Successfully segmented customers into **5 distinct groups**.
- Identified high-spending customers for premium product targeting.
- Developed tailored marketing strategies based on age and income profiles.
- Improved understanding of customer behaviors through data visualization.
